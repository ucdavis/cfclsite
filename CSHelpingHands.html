    <p>Imperial County sits along the border with Mexico in California’s southeastern corner. Known as the
      nation’s “winter salad bowl,” this region produces half of all the winter vegetables grown in the
      United States. But despite its highly productive agricultural industry, local communities still struggle
      with access to healthy, affordable food.</p>
      <p>
        Helping Hands Active Knights (HHAK) was a multi-year YPAR initiative formed at Meadows Union K-8
        Elementary School located in the desert about 5 miles east of El Centro and surrounded by
        agricultural fields. The HHAK team worked with staff from Imperial County’s University of California
        Cooperative Extension office in collaboration with CalFresh Healthy Living, UC and the local After
        School Education and Safety (ASES) Program to focus on issues related to food access, nutrition and
        physical activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For their first year, HHAK members researched the issue of low physical fitness levels and inadequate
        physical activity equipment at their school. During their second year, the team of 14 6th, 7th and 8th
        grade students chose to build upon their initial success by focusing on food waste in their cafeteria.
        HHAK members started by auditing their own eating habits. They then conducted a plate waste study
        in their cafeteria to assess the total quantity of food typically thrown away by students during lunch
        time. For this research effort, they used observation and photography to document their peers’
        actions during an entire lunch period and measured the amount of fruits and vegetables each student
        chose to throw away that day. Overall, they processed and weighed the leftover food items from 363
        lunch trays.
      </p>
      <p>
        HHAK members discovered that their school of less than 500 students threw away 53.6 lbs of corn,
        2.1 lbs of pineapple, 4.5 lbs of apples, 3 lbs of watermelon and 1.5 lbs of carrots during one lunch
        period. While some of the numbers were a bit lower than what they’d expected to see, they

        demonstrated how dramatically food waste can add up over time by estimating how much food
        would be wasted at their school in an entire academic year. They were shocked to realize that this
        could equate to almost 8,000 lbs of uneaten corn over the course of a school year!
      </p>
      <p>
        For their final report, HHAK members recorded a slide presentation to share their findings and
        recommendations with the district superintendent and their school principal. Working with the Food
        Services Director, HHAK was able to get a share table installed in their cafeteria to save and
        redistribute unwanted food. Their efforts were also recognized at a School Board meeting at the end
        of the school year.
