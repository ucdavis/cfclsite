      Over the course of two decades, Fathers &amp; Families of San Joaquin (FFSJ) embedded YPAR
      within its practice, integrating it into their healing justice work with formerly incarcerated and
      system-impacted youth and families as well as efforts to promote educational equity and
      environmental justice. Youth In Focus had the privilege of working with FFSJ early on in its
      development, supporting a needs assessment that helped launch the organization’s work. This
      partnership continued for many years, with FFSJ facilitating YPAR projects in collaboration with
      staff from the UC Davis Center for Regional Change and its Putting Youth on the Map Program,
      amongst others.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFSJ was born and operated under the core belief that the people closest to the problems are
      closest to the solutions. By integrating YPAR into their organizational structure and practices
      from the beginning, staff and youth leaders learned how to conduct research and use data in
      combination with their own stories and lived experiences to support direct action and systemic
      change in Stockton and throughout California’s San Joaquin Valley. Central to these efforts was
      their healing justice work, which included traditional healing ceremonies, sweat lodges, healing
      circles, and naming ceremonies. Their healing strategy was based on four central principles:
    </p>

    <div id="quick_nums">
    
      <p> &emsp;&emsp;1. Healing is political;</p>
        
      <p> &emsp;&emsp;2. Healing and organizing intersect;</p>

      <p> &emsp;&emsp;3. Healing responds to the needs of the community; and</p>

      <p> &emsp;&emsp;4. Healing is rooted in our spirituality and cultural traditions.</p>   
      
    </div>
    <p>
      FFSJ facilitated numerous YPAR projects, including photovoice and air monitoring projects
      examining environmental injustice in South Stockton and a youth-produced documentary
      exploring the true costs of youth incarceration for formerly incarcerated youth, system-impacted families, and society as a whole. The organization’s early efforts led to the creation of
      a youth and family empowerment zone in Downtown Stockton, which included a youth
      empowerment center, an elder center, and a healing center that all provided a holistic set of
      supports. In addition, FFSJ was a key member of ESPINO (Escuelas Sí, Pintas No [Schools Yes,
      Prisons No]) a coalition formed in 2003 to bring attention and effort to dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. ESPINO focused its collective YPAR efforts on the issue of racism within the
      juvenile justice and education systems in order to create progressive systemic change while
      working to develop critical consciousness for empowerment and action among the Central
      Valley’s immigrant, migrant, refugee, and other communities of color.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFSJ’s years of YPAR work left an indelible legacy, decolonizing research and data in Stockton
      and across California to reshape the built environment, redefine public safety, and help youth
      and adults envision and co-create a more just and equitable future.
