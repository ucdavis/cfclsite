      Youth In Focus had the privilege of working with Fathers & Families of San Joaquin (FFSJ) early
      on in its development, supporting a needs assessment that helped launch the organization’s
      work. This partnership has continued into the present day, with FFSJ facilitating YPAR projects in
      collaboration with staff from the UC Davis Center for Regional Change and its Putting Youth on
      the Map Program, amongst others. Over the past two decades, FFSJ has embedded YPAR within
      its practice, integrating it into their healing justice work with formerly incarcerated and system-impacted youth and families as well as efforts to promote educational equity and environmental
      justice. The following is FFSJ’s story as told by the organization’s founder and Executive Director,
      Samuel “Sammy” Nuñez.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are incarcerated you are seen as less than human. Oppression has an order. Lies,
      misinformation and half-truths are repeated until people start to believe them, even the target
      population. If you are bad you can never be good. If you are bad you deserve nothing but a
      cage. Messages turn into policies and lead to destabilization. Fear-based reality divides us from
      each other. It creates imbalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t have a plan. I just wanted to do something positive for my neighborhood and people.
      We were suffering. I was suffering. I wanted to know <span style="font-style: italic;">how do you stop the pain?</span> And so I
      stepped in. My experience told me that if we didn’t do it no one else would.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we started we had no money, no office, we only had the parks. We wanted to wake up
      the people and serve them with dignity. We gathered young fathers and started meeting as a
      group in the public park. We weren’t looking for an organization, we were just looking for
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data can be weaponized and used against us to create a misdiagnosis. We knew the diagnosis
      was wrong. The treatment plan was a punishment plan and it was causing more harm. If you
      know something is causing harm and do nothing to prevent it you are also complicit. We
      needed to examine the problem for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went through YPAR training and learned how to do research and break down data. The data
      started telling us a story about how the violence began, why it continued and how it was rooted
      in the state through policies and practices that targeted our people. Then we could see the
      linkages by connecting the data with our lived experiences.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">
      When you become masterful at YPAR and you have the experiences that can add depth and
      substance to the data, it gives numbers spirit, heart, soul. You can feel it. This is really about
      telling a story of what we already knew. Then we can attack this issue rather than react to it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 2003, we became part of a coalition called ESPINO [Escuelas Sí, Pintas No (Schools Yes,
      Prisons No)]. This brought our work to another level. We began to radically imagine a different
      world. We saw we needed a language of love that would penetrate through hate, despair, fear.
      We decided to target the school-to-prison pipeline and realized we were the hope we had been
      waiting for. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Nothing about us without us is for us.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We couldn’t breathe long before COVID-19 decimated our community. Stockton knew what it
      was like to live amid an epidemic. The epidemic of a war that targeted our brown and black
      communities. The epidemic of a mortgage crisis and years of gentrification that pushes hard-
      working families out of their homes. The epidemic of an economy that relies on our labor but
      denies working people dignity and respect. An epidemic of trauma, illiteracy, and violence
      caused by cycles of poverty which leave people hurting, hopeless, and with few opportunities
      for change.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time Stockton was in bankruptcy, with racial toxic inequity and policies that placed
      burdens that people had to shoulder instead of removing the burdens that weighed in their
      hearts. The Central Valley was seeing the biggest prison expansion in our history. It is a dark
      shameful time in California. Prisons were promised to be a resource engine to the regional
      economy and they were making us sicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand something you have to understand how it is connected to everything.
      That was an epiphany. We looked at data and trends, forecasts and algorithms. Prisons were
      not the resource engine that they were professed to be. We had data to prove it. We used
      YPAR to see this and think about systems that would be better. It also exposed the root
      problem: white supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loving yourself in a society that teaches you to hate yourself is a revolutionary act. We saw the
      generational impact of compounded racial inequity. The actual burdens and barriers of

      structural racism. You can’t understand individual behavior without seeing that. Once you
      understand it you don’t fear it. You control your own destiny. Nothing could stop us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The State of California has a debt to pay to Stockton and the Central Valley. The State needs to
      see our wholeness and invest in our fullness to make good on that promise. Stockton will move
      this state—as Stockton goes, so goes the Valley; and as the Valley goes, so goes the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      We launched a campaign and started doing direct action and publishing our own reports. We
      wrote the <span style="font-weight: bold;">State of the Hood</span> to talk about the state of childhood, parenthood, neighborhoods
      in the Valley using data plus our own experiences. Our fundamental agenda was healing.
      Healing the wounds of generational trauma to enable reconciliation. You can’t move a healing
      agenda through a punishment model. It has to be transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proper diagnosis is half the cure and the key to survival. The problem isn’t our people. We
      know that all life is sacred, everyone has intrinsic worth and together we can be instruments of
      peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that for decades, California’s policies and investments have treated poverty and
      trauma with solutions that don’t work—policing and incarceration, distrust and disinvestment.
      It’s made us sicker. And we are sick of being sick and tired of being tired. We have now taken
      matters into our own hands. We are at the epicenter where the impact is located; where the
      point of impact is concentrated. We believe that people closest to the problems are closest to
      the solutions to change the trajectory and chart a new course.
    </p>

    <p>
      We started doing work to bring mamas and papas home, heal them up and then activate them.
      Our world view was shaped by the past. We needed to see what could be. We needed to take
      this data and create a new reality. These are the origins of our agency and the genetic code of
      our foundation. Our DNA is pain, shame, power, harmony, and healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gang injunctions had fueled land grabs throughout the state. We created a movement in
      Stockton to reclaim this land. We created a youth and family empowerment zone. It includes a
      healing center, youth empowerment center, and an elder center. We started to provide access
      to traditional healing ceremonies, sweat lodges, healing circles, and naming ceremonies. These
      ceremonies gave us the cohesion and spiritual fortitude to face these monsters together. This
      became the basis of our work. We needed to heal, deal, and keep it real.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our healing strategy has 4 tenets. Healing is political; Healing and Organizing intersect; Healing
      responds to the needs of the community; and Healing is rooted in our spirituality and cultural
      traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are an anchor in the region and have been putting Stockton on the map. We are the most
      diverse city in America, and the most segregated city in America. We are using our
      infrastructure and decolonizing data to reshape the built environment, redefine public safety,
      and renew the spirit of our people toward imagining a new future. The future can heal the past.

      We began a new lineage with new memories, new hopes, and new visions not grounded in
      suffering and scarcity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next phase is  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stockton Rooted. Stockton Reimagined. Stockton Reclaimed.</span> By building
      BLOCS (Building Love, Opportunity & Connectivity in Stockton). They don’t want us on their
      blocks, so we have to build our own by reclaiming the land and re-rooting our community.
      There is a crisis of capitalism in our state. You see it over and over and over. People are being
      pushed away and out. We want to acquire land so that at least more than 20% of Stocktonians
      own land. Prisons are closing in our area and we want to repurpose this land and grow through
      it. We want to create gardens, housing, healing centers. We want to turn the state-of-the-art
      prison hospital into a community hospital. These are the things we need to replenish and
      renew. It’s critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long run we want to build capacity to solve our own problems. In 20 years, we should all
      still be here. The children who are growing up now should still be here, raising families, with
      their parents as grandparents, growing gardens, harmony and healing.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we continue to see massive gentrification from the Bay Area, regional inequity is stark and
      real. Our people have long known what it takes to survive a pandemic: hope, healing, and love.
      Stockton is the centerpiece of the Civil Rights Movement of our generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment is right now. The question is what kind of ancestors will we be? We will be defined
      by the investments and choices we make today. Let us live to our espoused values as the
      Golden State.
