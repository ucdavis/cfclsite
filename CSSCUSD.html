      How do we create equitable, transformative and healing-centered school environments? Since
      2013, the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) has been a tool to help California school
      districts think strategically about equity, their priorities and their budgets. The plan focuses on
      improving outcomes for many of the most vulnerable students in the state. It is also intended
      to center local voices in decision making, including students, parents, and community
      stakeholders. Each year, districts go through a study session and set goals to improve outcomes
      for key groups of students including foster youth, African American youth, English Language
      Learners, students dealing with homelessness and students with disabilities. The final step is
      creating a plan and budget to implement these goals. The plan has teeth because it guides
      district budgeting and the school district’s board has to sign off on it. It's a high stakes and high
      profile process in many school districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it mean to authentically engage young people, especially those who are most
      impacted, in this kind of decision-making process? How can this be done in the middle of a
      crisis, when a school district is facing extreme budget cuts?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD) wanted to find a meaningful way to engage
      students in their LCAP process, even though the district was facing a serious budget crisis.
      Taking inspiration from other districts, the Youth Development Department at SCUSD decided
      to use YPAR as a way for youth leaders to talk with other youth across the district about their
      needs and priorities. At the same time they were developing youth leadership, they were also
      getting real information to inform LCAP priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first challenge was finding a YPAR team. The SCUSD Student Advisory Council was a natural
      choice. They were working with the superintendent and the district’s Youth Development
      Department on district-level issues. However, while they represented high schools across the
      district, these were, for the most part, students who were already engaged in school and doing
      well. In collecting data, they had to make sure that they fully represented students that were
      underserved and often least involved in district conversations. They decided to form

      partnerships with other youth leadership bodies across the district—groups that represented
      African American students, Native American students, foster youth and other key LCAP
      constituencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second challenge was to help the team understand a complex process like LCAP
      development. Even though these students were engaged in district leadership, none of them
      knew about this process. The district’s LCAP Coordinator came in and did trainings for the team
      just to understand the context, what they were there to do and why.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team met weekly in the district office with an adult coordinator. They decided to focus on
      three deceptively simple questions: What are issues you face? What are the issues you face in
      school? What changes do you want to see? Through an initial survey they learned that students
      in their core communities faced five key issues: lack of sleep, mental fatigue, racial
      discrimination in schools, gender discrimination in schools and dress code discrimination. They
      then used public data and focus groups to go deeper into each of these issues—understanding
      both the details and the broader social context. At the heart of the research were huge
      questions about school climate and student wellbeing. The team had to think about how to link
      it to the district’s LCAP and make recommendations that would actually make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team had three main recommendations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hire mental health counselors
      </li>
      <li>
        Create and implement time management contracts (to contain the out-of-school work
        load put on students)
      </li>
      <li>
        Mandate training on race and gender for teachers, staff, campus monitors, and
        students
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As part of their leadership role they were very concerned with accountability. These
      issues—especially around addressing race, implicit bias and dress code enforcement in
      schools—had been raised over and over again. The youth leaders made it clear that they
      wanted a real follow up plan for all of their recommendations and that they planned to attend
      the monthly board meetings to advocate for their implementation. They found synergy and
      support with the parent LCAP leaders who were raising similar issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board immediately agreed to hire more mental health counselors and used the team’s
      report to help justify the expense. To continue momentum around ending racial and gender
      bias, the district’s youth media team picked up the findings and launched a social media
      campaign to highlight the different findings and messages across the district. Meanwhile, the
      Men’s and Women’s Leadership Academy—another youth leadership body in the
      district—initiated a deeper look at student and teacher relationships through a subsequent
      YPAR project the following school year that looked at healing and trauma-informed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCUSD demonstrated that even though it might be hard to engage youth in times of budget
      crises, those are times that are critical to have youth at the table, especially the youth who are
      most affected by cuts and least represented in decision-making processes.
