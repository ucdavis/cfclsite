    <p>What makes a community-based organization (CBO) feel trustworthy to youth? How well do
      city-funded CBOs serve youth? Those were the kinds of questions that drove Youth IMPACT, a
      project of the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF). Through
      comprehensive youth-led evaluations, Youth IMPACT gave young people a voice in how San
      Francisco invested resources for children and youth who live in the city. The findings of Youth
      IMPACT evaluations fed into the department’s strategic planning, funding and technical
      assistance processes. Youth In Focus first piloted the project with DCYF, and then trained the
      San Francisco-based Literacy for Environmental Justice to facilitate the next several years of
      work.</p>
      <p>
        In the first spring of the project, the Youth IMPACT team gathered together one afternoon for
        their weekly meeting. Exhausted and excited, they had just collected data from over 40 youth-
        serving organizations across San Francisco. Their data included over 850 questionnaires,
        transcripts from 35 focus groups, and summaries of 35 program observations. Their task was to
        analyze the data to answer two questions: How well are youth being served by CBOs funded by
        DCYF? And what makes a trustworthy youth-serving organization? Given the amount and the
        complexity of the data, this was no small task.
      </p>
      <p>
        By far the biggest challenge was to analyze the 850 surveys. The ten Youth IMPACT evaluators
        tackled this with Analyze-It Kits (which can be found in Stepping Stone 7). The kits helped team
        members focus their data analysis and break it down into bite-size pieces. Each Analyze-It Kit
        had a set of key questions and relevant statistical analysis of survey data (analyses were run by
        JMPT Consulting). Team members worked in small groups to complete the tasks set out in the
        kits. When all the kits were completed, the team was finished with the survey analysis. The next
        task was to analyze the focus groups. The whole team combed the data for key trends and
        evidence to back up findings. A quote scavenger hunt was playfully organized to find and pull
        spicy statements from the notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        All their hard work paid off! On the strength of their analysis the team developed the Ten
        Commandments for Youth Programs, which were published in “Youth Voices Inspiring Positive
        Change.” The commandments spelled out ten must-haves for every youth program in San
        Francisco. DCYF took Youth IMPACT’s findings very seriously. At a budget conference the
        following year, DCYF staff handed the booklet to every single organization applying for funding
        and said that all proposals would be partially evaluated based on Youth IMPACT’s ten
        commandments. DCYF committed to continue Youth IMPACT and to make youth-led evaluation
        “the way the City does business,” in the words of former DCYF Director Deborah Alvarez-
        Rodriguez.
