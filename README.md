# Community Futures, Community Lore Website

## Our Project
This is the website repository for Community Futures, Community Lore. We are an online resource dedicated to making culturally-rooted, youth participatory action research (YPAR) resources available for free.

This site was started in the summer of 2019, and it has come a long way since then. We are currently in version 1.0.0, and making edits for 1.1.0. 

This document is mainly for future web designers and developers who work on the project. If this isn't you, no worries! Feel free to take a look around anyway.

## High Level Decisions

### Domain and Hosting
We chose to use GitHub Pages to host the site, as the vast majority of the content is static and front-end. There may be a need to migrate off GitHub Pages in the future (see Recommendations below) but for now it works excellently. <<Include information about how to manage the GitHub pages stuff.>>

The domain name is registered with UC Davis. <<Include information about who to contact about the domain, and to not stop using the domain name.>>
