      This youth-led project investigated the needs of socio-economically disadvantaged lesbian, gay,
      bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, homosexual and intersex (LGBTQQHI) youth in San
      Francisco. The team’s goal was to understand what types of opportunities and resources would
      ensure equal treatment for LGBTQQHI youth and help improve their circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A team of four youth researchers surveyed 90 youth, conducted 4 focus groups with youth and
      service providers, and interviewed several service providers in order to discover the largest issues
      facing this community. An analysis of the data revealed that the top four challenges for socio-
      economically disadvantaged LGBTQQHI youth in San Francisco were housing, income/employment,
      substance use, and education. The team’s recommendations included a call for more client-centered
      policies at youth shelters, housing programs that support youth pursuing education (not just
      employment), and the hiring of youth at youth-serving organizations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The team pursued grant funding to implement several of their recommendations, facilitated
      presentations of their findings to the community, and created a zine to inform and inspire their peers.
      They also presented their findings to a room of over 150 people including elected officials, foundation
      staff, service providers, and their peers. For their work, the youth received a KQED Local Hero's
      Award.
