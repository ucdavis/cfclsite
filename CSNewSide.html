      With support from the Monterey County Office of Employment and Training, a team of 13 youth in
      the City of Seaside explored economic opportunities for youth in Monterey County. They conducted
      both qualitative and quantitative research to examine youth participation in the formal and
      underground economies. Youth researchers collected 300 surveys from community members across
      the county, took 100 photos of their community, and conducted 3 interviews.
    </p>
      <p>
        They discovered that a lack of economic opportunity was negatively impacting their community.
        Specifically, a weak local economy was disproportionately limiting employment prospects for African
        Americans and increasing the pressure on youth to seek illegal employment opportunities in the
        underground economy. Based on their findings, the team advocated for the creation of more jobs in
        Monterey County for youth and adults, particularly in the growing fields of language translation and
        green jobs. They also highlighted the need for employment opportunities that paid a living wage in
        order to curb participation in illegal activities.
