                participatory action
                research or YPAR, is an approach to community
                change that centers young people. YPAR gives youth tools and
                support to transform their community in partnership with
                allied adults. Youth team members identify and shape an issue
                they want to research and address to improve their school and/or
                community. YPAR engages young people in youth research
                and action that builds their skills and fosters strong, just
                communities and institutions. The ideas that underlie and inspire 
                this work can be traced to several different fields, including popular education, 
                participatory research and youth development grounded in social justice 
                and organizing.</p>
                </br>
                <p>The Community Futures, Community Lore approach to YPAR assumes
                    that young people are embedded in intergenerational communities
                    and that they are important participants in their communities’
                    evolution. Our approach supports and celebrates young people’s
                    participation in the long arc of this evolution. </p>

                </br><p>The Community Futures, Community Lore's field-tested approach grew out of decades of work
                    and the wisdom of hundreds of communities, dozens of trainers and thousands of youth
                    researchers and their allies. A highly-diverse team of young people drove the initial
                    development of this work and these materials through a youth-founded organization called
                    Youth In Focus (YIF). YIF was among the first YPAR innovators and practitioners in the United
                    States and even the globe. </br></br>
                    YIF developed a model known as Youth REP (youth-led research, evaluation and planning) and
                    centered its work on organizations that served youth and communities typically marginalized by
                    mainstream policies and institutions. In particular, it offered YPAR support in serving
                    youth of color, immigrant youth, LGBTQ youth and low-income youth and addressing a broad range
                    of issues (e.g. enhancing public health, strengthening after-school programs, reforming the
                    juvenile justice system, improving public schools). By the time the organization closed its doors
                    in 2010, YIF had worked with thousands of youth in over 200 projects and in dozens of
                    communities, leading young people in powerful experiential learning in the service of positive
                    social change. Many of the organization’s staff and youth and adult partners went on to be
                    leaders in YPAR and related fields and to use and adapt YIF’s original materials.

            </br><p>Yes! YPAR is often a really important, complementary
                component to other strategies that support youth leadership.
                YPAR has been used to support youth organizations and campaigns,
                youth governance (school and local government), youth
                engagement in philanthropy, community design and development,

            </br><p>YPAR, especially the CFCL approach, is effective in many

                will determine success is your community, organization
                or institution’s capacity and ability to support,

                critical roles in YPAR projects. In the CFCL approach, we
                emphasize the importance of intergenerational collaboration
                in YPAR projects. Adult partners play varied roles - from
                helping to define the initial purpose and parameters of the
                project, to collaborating on research design and analysis,
                to developing a strategy for action. The key, however, is

                    young people to put the findings of youth research

                    Adults often operate as coaches, thought partners,
                    advisors, content resources, and/or trainers on
                    projects. Sometimes they are facilitators, supervisors
                    and network builders.  Most importantly, the role of
                    adults in YPAR projects is to be fully engaged partners
                    with young people in learning how to establish and renew
                    healthy intergenerational relationships in our communities,

                    dedicate resources to this process (eg. dedicated time,
                    space, support, access to decision makers to ensure the
