                <p class="responce">YPAR, especially the CFCL approach, is effective in many
                    different settings and communities. The main thing that will
                    determine success is your community, organization or
                    institution to support, collaborate and incorporate the work of
                    youth leaders.</br></br>
                    Our approach has been adapted to projects that focus on
                    education (both project-based learning and school change),
                    public and community health; food and nutrition; youth
                    development programs; community development and design;
                    community history and cultural survival; environmental justice,
                    sustainability and stewardship, and more!</p>
