      After hearing that Woodland is considered a state “hot spot” for rates of teen pregnancy in
      California—and noticing a large number of their peers getting pregnant—a number of Woodland
      youth decided that an immediate response was needed. In the fall of 2001, a diverse group of
      Woodland youth leaders joined together to form Teens Supporting Teens to create an informed and
      active presence for youth in guiding sexual health services and broader community supports for
      teens.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a first approach to their mission, the group developed a survey to assess their peer’s attitudes and
      understandings of sexual health issues, and the kinds of support they perceive and desire in the
      community. To ensure that their data reflected the needs and views of the diversity of youth in
      Woodland, they created both an English and a Spanish version of the survey. They administered both
      versions of the survey in settings ranging from the local high school, health fairs, juvenile hall, local
      junior high schools and the local continuation high school. After
      analyzing the data, they made recommendations to their school on ways
      to make sexual health information and supportive services
      more accessible to youth.
